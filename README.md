# Universal Shared Memory Bridge

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to establish communication between different programming languages using shared memory. Shared memory provides a mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC) by allowing multiple processes, regardless of the programming language they are written in, to share a region of memory, enabling efficient data exchange between them.

## Components

1. **Shared Memory Library (`shared_memory`)**:

   - Provides functions to create shared memory, write data to shared memory, and read data from shared memory.
   - Implemented in a language-agnostic manner to be usable by different programming languages.
   - Exposes a simple API for interacting with shared memory.

2. **Language-Specific Bindings**:

   - For each programming language, create language-specific bindings to the shared memory library.
   - These bindings provide an interface for the programming language to call the shared memory functions.

3. **Shared Library / Dynamic Link Library (DLL)**:
   - Contains the core functionality for creating, writing to, and reading from shared memory.
   - Implemented using a language that supports low-level memory manipulation, such as C or C++.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**:

   - Compile the shared library source code (`shared_memory.c` or `shared_memory.cpp`) to generate the shared library or DLL.

   ```bash
   gcc -shared -fPIC -o shared_memory.so shared_memory.c
   ```

   - Ensure that the shared library/DLL is accessible to all programming languages that will use it.

2. **Language-Specific Usage**:

   - Import or include the language-specific bindings in your code.
   - Use the provided functions in the bindings to interact with shared memory, create, write to, and read from shared memory.

3. **Data Exchange**:
   - Use the shared memory functions to exchange data between processes written in different programming languages.
   - Data written to shared memory by one process can be read by another process, regardless of the language they are written in.

## Example

An example usage scenario is provided where a Python script produces data at regular intervals, writes it to shared memory. Then, a Node.js script consumes the data from shared memory and logs it. Similarly, a C++ program can read the data from shared memory and perform some processing on it.

## Dependencies

- For the shared library:
  - A language that supports low-level memory manipulation (e.g., C or C++)
- For language-specific bindings:
  - Libraries or tools for generating bindings (e.g., `ctypes` for Python, `ffi-napi` for Node.js)
- For each programming language:
  - Language-specific dependencies for calling external functions and interacting with shared memory
